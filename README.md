# Forking Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository is used for the **in-class forking practice** in Week 5, Day 2.

## Your Mission (5 minutes)

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Clone YOUR fork** to your computer — not this original!
3. **Open** the cloned folder in VS Code
4. **Open** `forking_practice.ipynb` and follow the steps inside
5. **Verify** with `git remote -v` that your username appears in the URL

## How to Tell if You Did It Right

Run this in the VS Code terminal (`` Ctrl+` ``):

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see **your** GitHub username:

```
✅ origin  https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/forking-practice (fetch)
❌ origin  https://github.com/instructor/forking-practice (fetch)  ← wrong
```

## Troubleshooting

- **Accidentally cloned the original?** Delete the folder and clone your fork instead.
- **Can't find your fork?** Go to `github.com/YOUR-USERNAME` — it should appear in your repositories list.
